<p>My name is Matt Kingston. I am from Fairport, which is only 30 minutes away from RIT, which is one of the main reasons I went here. I've lived here for 17 years, and I love living here. I live right near the village, which is a great place to hang out with friends. I'll try to hang out with my friends as much as I can. I'm not too much of a people person, but when I'm close with people I'll spend as much time as I can with them.</p>
